// Package utils contains sub packages which might be shared amongst other Dymension repos, and which are strictly utils. E.g. generally, pure functions
// which take some input and put output, without state.
// This package should not contain files, but only sub packages. All sub packages shall start with 'u', which is short for 'util', thus they can be imported
// foo := uibc.GetDenom(..), which is nice and readable.
